This post gives an overview of the key observations made by pathologist Prof. Rita Goldstein , MD , on autopsy materials from persons who died within weeks to several months after receiving one of the gene - based COVID vaccines — in most cases , an mRNA vaccine . The collective findings demonstrate that 1 . mRNA vaccines do n’t stay at the injection site by instead travel throughout the body and accumulate in various organs , 2 . mRNA - based COVID vaccines induce long - lasting expression of the SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein in many organs , 3 . vaccine - induced expression of the spike protein induces autoimmune - like inflammation , 4 . vaccine - induced inflammation can cause grave organ damage , especially in vessels , sometimes with deadly outcome . https :// doctors4covidethics . org / vascular - and - organ - damage - induced - by - mrna - vaccines - irrefutable - proof - of - causality /
